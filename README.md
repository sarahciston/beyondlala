# beyond LA in LA with Sarah

This is a repository for a mapping project inspired by Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA. The premise for the project is to help contextualize 
and learn more about Latino/a and Hispanic communities - especially with how they relate to the musuems and institutions that represent 
their work. The maps are made using the American Community Survey 2015 data.

In addition I wanted to make a map using CARTO as an alternative to some of the other mapping applications out there. I also wanted to share the data that I gathered so if you want to make your own map you can do so easily!

If you navigate to the data folder you will find the following files:

Pacific Standard Time 2017 - Primary - Sheet1.csvc - All Pacific Standard Time exhibits with metadata created from the PST website 
LA/LAPopulation_CensustTract_Data.zip - Data downloaded from Social Explorer. 2015 American Community Survey Data.

Say hello to Story, a brand new responsive one-pager for HTML5 UP! Inspired by my work
on Carrd*, Story is built to be extremely modular and tweakable, and as such is entirely
built on reusable, insanely customizable elements (like "spotlight" and "gallery") that
can be endlessly duplicated and tweaked into whatever you need to tell your story --
without, in many cases, touching *any* CSS. Check out index-demo.html for an interactive
demo, and index.html for the actual template. Enjoy!

you can use for pretty much whatever.

PS: Delete index-demo.html and assets/js/demo.js when you're done messing with the demo
as neither are needed in production :)
